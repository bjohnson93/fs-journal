# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? The ice cream shop on wednesday! I had a lot of fun with it and felt like I got a better grasp by that day on understanding, although javascript week has been very very hard!!
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? I was surprised to finally (somewhat) understand how to write draw functions! and during paired project on Thursday I thought I wouldn't be as helpful but I ended up having a lot of ideas that ended up being successful, and got to learn things from my partners, it was fun!
- What are you struggling with? I think game logic is going to be a difficult for me, but js in general is a lot.
- What would you count as a victory? Being able to successfully write out draw functions was a victory. Also, organizing my code and learning to pseudo code was really helpful, as I like to compartmentalize and it helps things seem less chaotic.
