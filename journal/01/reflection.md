# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    There was so much learning, I love being fully submerged so-to-speak with everyone after the same goal, it's so nice compared to being on your own! Learning css without bootstrap and then with bootstrap was a great humbling experience, it makes you really appreciate things.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    Learning bootstrap was a bit of a surprise as it simplified things, and the point made about 'skeletoning' out your page was SO helpful before getting hyperfocused on little details, ESPECIALLY for going from desktop to small screens.
- What are you struggling with?
    I initially really struggled with making your page responsive due to being focused on little details rather than skeletoning out your page, but after day 4 I feel much better about that. Flexboxing I need to review more, and I'm very thankful for the flexbox froggy learning tool- I've told other people about it even!
- What would you count as a victory?
    Day 3 trying to make my page responsive and feeling like I was failing at it to day 4 feeling like a 'WINNER' would be my victory. Also, media queries seemed so intimidating initially but by day 4 were making more sense.
